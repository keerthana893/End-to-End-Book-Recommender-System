create a repository in git hub 
then open the terminal from the folder where you want to keep the files related to this project
clone the link from the code option in the repository ...copy the http link and paste it in terminal with (git clone LINK) command... ( git clone https://github.com/keerthana893/End-to-End-Book-Recommender-System.git)
we are opening the folder (cd project name)-( cd End-to-End-Book-Recommender-System/)
then the folder is craeted in the System
inside the project folder open the code option-lead to vs code with folder created in vs code
craete a conda command/environment after opening the repository-to install some libraries here and create environment for the project
3.7 python version is stable-we will not get any error with this version,if it is new version libraries will be unstable and error will keep on popping
for that in vs code terminal or in system terminal- conda create -n books python=3.7.10 -y
then activate this envi-( conda activate books )
envi got activated
create a folder -requirements.txt-enter the list of libraries we need...then (pip install -r requirements.txt)-this will install all the packages we have entered in this folder
